* The user enters the name and the brand of the food to substitute. The website find a list of substitute foods from the same category and with a better [nutriscore](https://fr.openfoodfacts.org/score-nutritionnel-france).
* Cliking on each substitute food the user can have more information about it.
* If registered and signed in, the user can save the healthy products found in the substitute list and then consult his selection. Each selected food can also be deleted.

* You can also and more easily go directly online at [Pur Beurre](https://purbeurre8.herokuapp.com/) website, deployed with *Heroku*.


## How to update de category and food data ?

* Pur Beurre has been developped with 10 different categories of food. See the name of these categories in the **CATEGORIES_LIST** (*pur_beurre/food/constants.py*). If you want to change it - add some more or drop ones - just modify that list before running an update.
